# Huffman Compression #

## A short demo program in C. ##

This command line app compresses and decompresses files using Huffman's coding. As an input it is required to specify 2 parameters.

1. c or d for compression or decompression
2. name of file to be compressed/decompressed

Works best for uncompressed text or graphics files. All files that already use some form of compression (jpg, mp3) won't yield good results.
